   ```python
   # Example from the House Price Prediction notebook
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the dataset
   train_data = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
   test_data = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
   sample_submission = pd.read_csv("sample_submission.csv")
   ```

2. **Iris Flower Classification**: Embark on a botanical adventure by building a model to classify iris flowers based on sepal and petal dimensions.

   ```python
   # Example from the Iris Flower Classification notebook
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

   # Load the Iris dataset
   iris = load_iris()
   ```

3. **Wine Quality Prediction**: Uncork the secrets of wine quality prediction through regression techniques.

   ```python
   # Load the Wine Quality dataset
   wine_data = pd.read_csv("winequality-red.csv")

   # Explore the dataset
   print(wine_data.head())
   print(wine_data.info())
   ```

4. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Unmask fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced anomaly detection.

   ```python
   # Example from the Credit Card Fraud Detection notebook
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the credit card transactions data
   data = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")

   # Explore the dataset
   print(data.head())
   print(data.info())
   ```

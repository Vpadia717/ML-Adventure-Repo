## Introduction

In this repository, we embark on a journey of exploration and discovery in the realm of machine learning and data analysis. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the ropes or an experienced data scientist seeking inspiration, you will find something valuable here.

## Tasks

Our collection of Jupyter Notebooks covers a wide range of tasks, including:

1. **House Price Prediction**: Predicting house sale prices based on various features using regression models.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet from the House Price Prediction notebook
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('data/house_prices.csv')
   ```

2. **Iris Flower Classification**: Building a model to classify iris flowers based on sepal and petal dimensions.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet from the Iris Flower Classification notebook
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

   # Load the Iris dataset
   iris = load_iris()
   ```

3. **Wine Quality Prediction**: Predicting the quality of wine based on its features using regression.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet from the Wine Quality Prediction notebook
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the wine quality dataset
   wine_data = pd.read_csv('data/wine_quality.csv')
   ```

4. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using anomaly detection.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet from the Credit Card Fraud Detection notebook
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the credit card transactions data
   credit_card_data = pd.read_csv('data/credit_card_transactions.csv')
   ```

... (similar code snippets for other tasks)

Each task is documented in its respective Jupyter Notebook, with detailed explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Usage
